# 🔥Ignite

Ignite is a simple web application designed to provide users with daily motivational quotes to boost their spirits and inspire success. It was created as a project to learn and apply the **Fisher-Yates Algorithm** for shuffling quotes randomly rather than the predictable **'Math.random()'** function. If you're looking for a quick dose of motivation, Ignite has you covered! <br><br>
